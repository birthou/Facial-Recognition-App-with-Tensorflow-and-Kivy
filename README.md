# Facial-Recognition-App-with-Tensorflow-and-Kivy
building a model using Deep Learning with TensorFlow which replicates what is shown in the paper titled Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition. Once that's all trained you'll be able to integrate it into a Kivy app and actually authenticate!
